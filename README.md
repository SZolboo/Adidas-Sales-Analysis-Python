This can involve investing in creating new products, improving current offerings based on what consumers want, and making sure they have the right amount of inventory to meet changing customer demands.

**Localized Marketing Approach:** Since different cities have shown variations in retailer success, it's clear that local market trends matter. To take advantage of this, businesses should tailor their marketing for each region. This could involve things like researching local preferences, teaming up with influencers in those areas, and creating marketing messages that specifically connect with customers in different places.

**Price Sensitivity Management:** Given the observed price sensitivity among customers, businesses should carefully manage pricing strategies to strike a balance between maximizing revenue and maintaining competitive pricing. This may involve conducting pricing experiments, offering discounts or promotions strategically, and continuously monitoring market trends to adjust pricing strategies accordingly.

**Channel Diversification and Optimization:** Optimizing each sales pipeline through targeted marketing actions, streamlined operations, and enhanced customer experiences can drive overall sales performance and profitability.
